               <p><span class="smallCaps h4--naked">Raised an extroverted only child in Florence, New Jersey,</span> B. Sharise Moore’s love of literature was ignited by the wit of Roald Dahl, Judy Blume, and Countee Cullen. In 2001, she earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English and Creative Writing from Rutgers University. Between 1998 and 2011 she chiefly wrote and performed poetry; producing 5 chapbooks, 3 CDs, slam titles, awards, and appearances in literary journals. She became a certified English instructor in 2004, teaching courses in English, Drama, Journalism, and Language Arts before leaving the classroom to pursue master’s degrees in Fine Arts and Curriculum.</p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p>In 2008, she self-published Taste, which was dubbed “a fantastic story and multifaceted tale” by A. Kai of the Raw Sistaz Reviewers. At present, she is working on a historical fantasy YA novel and stage play while serving as a member of the Diverse Writers and Artists of Speculative Fiction (DWASF).</p>
